[Prophesies & Soy Sauce Shots](https://kelly-strayhorn.org/events/ws24-caroline-yoo-davine-byon/) is an experimental performance with artists Caroline Yoo and Davine Byon. They move together, rejecting the permanently aspirational future and reflecting on the consequences of ancestral dreamwork. The performance asks, are we dreaming in resistance of or within the confines of colonized standards of success? They move through three vignettes, using projections, sculpture, music, and the exchange of dreams. This new performance in process pieces together a messy, precious home in the diaspora, and asks whose dreams – past, present, and future – we are living for.
